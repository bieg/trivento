# trivento
opdracht

Following the brief below I only was bale to do the first part.
Reason for this is 3 ways: The days before the end of the year are always exteremely busy due to peple switching insurrances.
It is basicvally all hands on deck. Secondly is of course due to the festivities. When picking this task up I could not get the given repo to work.
After trying twice I turned it around and decided to use Angular2-cli. As mentioned earlier I am not proficient in Ang2. This therefore took me quite a while.
So as a steep learning and as a challenge I used ang2. 

As you will see I just could not figure out how to display only one card instead of all when cliked.

The app is responsive as it hase been set up with Bootstrap.

It was a very nice and interesting assignement but certain things are just rather too technical to me.
Of course I would very much like to continiue bridging this gap.


cheers
